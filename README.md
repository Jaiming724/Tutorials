  - To contribute code in OpenPSU's project repository, it is beneficial to learn what Git and Github are, and what they do.
  - Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.
  - GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features.
  - Here are some suggested tutorials to develop these skills: (I recommend starting with FreeCodeCamp's beginners crash-course
